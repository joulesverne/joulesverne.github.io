          <h2>Hi</h2>
          <p>I'm an electrical engineer and co-founder of <a href="https://www.waveworks.tech/">WaveWorks</a>, where we make chips that let wireless devices move more data for less power. Previously I co-invented Ambient Backscatter, pioneered techniques around ambient RF energy harvesting, and developed battery-free sense &amp; edge compute systems. I'm based in Seattle, Washington.</p>

          <p>WaveWorks is bringing a radically different type of wireless connectivity solution into the mainstream. Standard-protocol backscatter comms is cheaper, lower power, and can even enable battery-free networking. I'm a co-founder and CEO of WaveWorks.</p>

          <h3>AMBIENT BACKSCATTER</h3>

          </a>
          <p>In graduate school, I co-invented and developed technologies to allow devices to talk by reflecting ambient radio signals. This is maybe the latest incarnation of <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Communication-by-Means-of-Reflected-Power-Goldsmith/778e09875edcabd7d9c5a5425e7b5788882ee9cc?p2df">Harry Stockman's 1948 dream</a> of using reflections to communicate.

          <h3>WISP</h3>

          <p>The <a href="https://github.com/wisp">WISP</a> is an open-source, software-defined RFID tag built around a low-power MSP430 microcontroller. It's powered wirelessly, and so doesn't have or need a battery. The WISP is a long-running project of my PhD advisor, Prof. Joshua Smith, and I was lucky enough to be involved in the development and promotion of the WISP 5.</p>

          </a>
          <p>The built environment is full of radio frequency energy from sources such as cell towers, broadcast television transmitters, and WiFi access points. I've helped to create <a href="content/2014-MultibandHarvesting.pdf">new systems for efficiently harvesting and combining</a> the ambient energy from all these sources.</p>
