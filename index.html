          <h1>Hi</h1>
          <p>I'm an electrical engineer and co-founder of <a href="https://www.waveworks.tech/" target="_blank">WaveWorks</a>, where we make chips that let wireless devices move more data for less power. Previously I co-invented Ambient Backscatter, pioneered techniques around ambient RF energy harvesting, and developed battery-free sense &amp; edge compute systems. I'm based in Seattle, Washington.</p>
          <p>Please don't hesitate to contact me at: <a href="mailto:aaronparks@ieee.org" target="_blank">aaronparks@ieee.org</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.waveworks.tech/" target="_blank">WaveWorks</a> is bringing a radically different type of wireless connectivity solution into the mainstream. Standard-protocol backscatter comms is cheaper, lower power, and can even enable battery-free networking. I'm a co-founder and CEO of WaveWorks.</p>

            <h3>AMBIENT BACKSCATTER</h3>

            </a>
            <p>In graduate school, I co-invented and developed technologies to allow devices to talk by reflecting ambient radio signals. This is maybe the latest incarnation of <a href="https://simson.net/ref/1948/stockman.pdf" target="_blank">Harry Stockman's 1948 use</a> of reflections to communicate. Learn more in my <a href="content/parks-thesis.pdf" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://github.com/wisp" target="_blank">WISP</a> is an open-source, software-defined RFID tag built around a low-power MSP430 microcontroller. It's powered wirelessly, and so doesn't have or need a battery. The WISP is a long-running project of my PhD advisor, Prof. Joshua Smith, and I was lucky enough to be involved in the development and promotion of the WISP 5.</p>

            <h3>AMBIENT RF ENERGY HARVESTING</h3>

            </a>
            <p>The built environment is full of radio frequency energy from sources such as cell towers, broadcast television transmitters, and WiFi access points. I've helped to create <a href="content/2014-MultibandHarvesting.pdf" target="_blank">new systems for efficiently harvesting and combining</a> the ambient energy from all these sources.</p>
